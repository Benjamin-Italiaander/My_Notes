    The Eckhart Tolle Formula for Dealing with Difficult Situations</h1>
    <p>Eckhart Tolle explains that in every uncomfortable or challenging
    situation, you ultimately have three conscious choices. These
    choices bring clarity, calmness, and responsibility back to
    yourself.</p>
    <h2 id="acceptance">1. ✔️ Acceptance</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Can I accept the situation exactly
    as it is?</em> Sometimes a situation cannot be changed immediately.
    By fully accepting what is happening, you release inner resistance
    and create space for peace and clarity.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="change">2. 🔧 Change</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Can I change the situation so it
    becomes okay for me and for everyone involved?</em> If there is
    something you can influence, explore what action you can take. Small
    or big adjustments may improve the situation for all parties.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="leaving">3. 🚶 Leaving</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Can I remove myself from this
    situation?</em> When acceptance is not possible and change is not
    realistic, one healthy choice remains: stepping away. Leaving —
    physically, emotionally, or mentally — can protect your well-being
    and help you regain balance.</p>
    <hr />
    <h1 id="summary">🌱 Summary</h1>
    <p>Tolle’s three options help you stay calm, aware, and honest with
    yourself in any difficult situation:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Accept</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Change</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Leave</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If none of these happen, suffering continues. Choosing one of
    these paths gives you back control over your inner peace.</p>
