    <p>Under the cheerful influence of my ex-girlfriend
    <strong>Hannah</strong>, I once bought a piece of Japanese art from
    an online auction straight from Japan.<br />
    When that first scroll arrived, it instantly filled me with joy â€”
    the colours, the calmness, the stories hidden in every
    brushstroke!<br />
    From that moment on, I completely fell in love with traditional
    Japanese art.<br />
    I kept exploring, discovering, and collecting a few more beautiful
    pieces that made me smile.<br />
    Here, Iâ€™m sharing some of the artworks that continue to bring me
    peace, happiness, and inspiration. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸ’«</p>
