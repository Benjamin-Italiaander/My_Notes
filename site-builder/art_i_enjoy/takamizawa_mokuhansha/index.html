    id="discovering-takamizawa-mokuhansha-and-the-art-of-japanese-lithography">Discovering
    Takamizawa Mokuhansha and the Art of Japanese Lithography</h1>
    <p>During my search for <em>Takamizawa Mokuhansha</em>, a Japanese
    wood-block print publisher, I came across the website of
    <strong>George C. Baxley</strong>, who shared some wonderful images
    showing how lithographs and wood-block prints are made.</p>
    <p>On his site, he states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“Any person is hereby authorized to view, copy, print and
    distribute this document subject to the following conditions:<br />
    – The document may be used for personal informational purposes
    only;<br />
    – The document may only be used for non-commercial purposes;<br />
    – Any copy of this document, or any portion thereof, must include
    this copyright notice.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Based on that, I believe I’m allowed to use some of these
    beautiful images from his site to illustrate how the different
    wood-block and lithographic prints were created.</p>
    <p>Baxley’s website also includes a fascinating history of the
    <strong>Fujiya Hotel</strong>, complete with images, drawings, and
    lithographs.<br />
    Altogether, I decided to keep these here because I really enjoy them
    and want to share them — especially the Japanese art, which I find
    particularly inspiring.</p>

    <h2 id="about-takamizawa-mokuhansha-高見沢木版社">About Takamizawa
    Mokuhansha (高見沢木版社)</h2>
    <h3 id="origins-background">Origins &amp; Background</h3>
    <p>Takamizawa Mokuhansha (高見沢木版社) was a <strong>Tokyo-based
    publisher</strong> specializing in <em>mokuhanga</em> (木版画,
    wood-block printing).<br />
    The company appears to have been founded or led by brothers
    <strong>Masuro Takamizawa</strong> and <strong>Tadao
    Takamizawa</strong> (高見沢 忠雄).<br />
    Active roughly from the <strong>1930s through the 1980s</strong>,
    the firm was renowned for <strong>high-quality colour
    reproductions</strong> of classical ukiyo-e prints as well as a
    number of original designs.</p>
    <p>Their reproductions often included complete sets of historic
    works, such as <strong>Hiroshige’s <em>The 53 Stations of the
    Tōkaidō</em></strong>, rendered with remarkable fidelity.<br />
    Prints by Takamizawa were typically marked with the company’s seal
    “高見沢木版社”, which confirmed authenticity and separated them from
    lower-quality reproductions of the era.</p>
    <h3 id="significance">Significance</h3>
    <p>Takamizawa Mokuhansha played an important role in preserving and
    popularizing <strong>traditional Japanese printmaking</strong>
    during the 20th century.<br />
    Their studio combined the craftsmanship of hand-carved blocks and
    hand-printed colours with modern distribution, allowing global
    audiences to experience the beauty of classic ukiyo-e designs.</p>

    <p>Exploring Takamizawa Mokuhansha’s prints deepened my appreciation
    for how Japan’s wood-block tradition continued well into the modern
    era.<br />
    Each piece connects classical artistry with 20th-century
    craftsmanship — a quiet testament to how art forms evolve yet remain
    timeless.</p>
