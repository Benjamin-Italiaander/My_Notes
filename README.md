## 👋 Hi, I’m Benjamin

Not just an open-source fan — a self-proclaimed advocate of open source.

Primary things I work with: **Python**, **Nginx**, **Zabbix**, **OpenVPN**, **Grafana**, and **Bash**.

## 🧭 What I’m working on

### ✔️ Empowering organizations with full ownership of their data
Over the past decade, big tech platforms have accumulated huge amounts of data inside their cloud ecosystems.  
Governments, research institutes, and universities are increasingly aware of the risks around **data control, ownership, and security**.

I’m developing a practical blueprint to help organizations become more independent by designing the rollout and infrastructure for digital collaboration hubs (email + enterprise applications) built on open-source foundations.
