## 🎵 **Verse**

```
Am        F
I am not the only traveler
C         G
Who has not repaid his debt
Am            F
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
C              G
Take me back to the night we met
```

---

## 🎵 **Pre-Chorus**

```
Am           F
And then I can tell myself
C            G
What the hell I'm supposed to do
Am              F
And then I can tell myself
C               G
Not to ride along with you
```

---

## 🎵 **Chorus**

```
F            C
I had all and then most of you
G            Am
Some and now none of you
F            C
Take me back to the night we met
G            Am
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
F            C
Haunted by the ghost of you
G            Am
Oh, take me back to the night we met
```

## 🎵 **Bridge**

```
Am   F   C   G
Oh, oh, oh
Am   F   C   G
Oh, oh, oh
```
