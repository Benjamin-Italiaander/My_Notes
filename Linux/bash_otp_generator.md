# Create an OTP MFA Tool in the Bash Terminal

I was tired of using **Google Authenticator**, so I found a simple way to generate my own **OTP (One-Time Password)** codes directly in **Bash**.  
Just replace the example string below (`JHJH...`) with your own secret key.

```bash
/usr/bin/oathtool -b --totp 'JHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJ'
```

If you want to copy the token directly to your clipboard, just use **xclip**:

```bash
/usr/bin/oathtool -b --totp 'JHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJHJ' | xclip -selection c
```

This way, you can easily run your own OTP generator right in the terminal.

## üîê Encrypting Your Secret with GPG

If you want to keep your secret key secure, you can encrypt it with **GPG**.
Here‚Äôs a simple working example ‚Äî make sure both **gpg** and **oathtool** are installed first.

```bash
# This example decrypts a GPG file (example.gpg) and generates an OTP token
secret="$(gpg -d ./example.gpg 2>/dev/null)"
token="$(/usr/bin/oathtool -b --totp $secret)"
echo $token
```

## üß© Turning It Into a Script

If you‚Äôd like to make this a small reusable script, here‚Äôs an example that can either print the token to the screen or copy it to your clipboard automatically.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

gentoken() {
    # Generate an OTP token from a GPG-encrypted file
    secret="$(gpg -d ./otp_secret_example.gpg 2>/dev/null)"
    token="$(/usr/bin/oathtool -b --totp $secret)"
}

Help() {
    # Simple help menu
    echo 
    echo "OTP token generator for user John (Office Portal)."
    echo
    echo "Syntax: $0 [-h|c|p]"
    echo "Options:"
    echo "  -h     Show this help message"
    echo "  -c     Copy token to clipboard"
    echo "  -p     Print token to screen"
    echo
}

prtoken() {
    # Print token to screen
    gentoken
    echo "$token"
}

cptoken() {
    # Copy token to clipboard using xclip
    gentoken
    echo "$token" | xclip -selection c 
}

# Parse command-line options
while getopts ":hpc" option; do
    case $option in
        h) Help; exit;;
        p) prtoken; exit;;
        c) cptoken; exit;;
        \?) echo "Error: Invalid option. Use -h for help."; exit;;
    esac
done
```
