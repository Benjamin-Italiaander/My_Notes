# Reading markDown files in the Linux commandline

One handy tool i came across is 
[Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) well maintained and easy to use 

[frogmouth](https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth) is a simple MD vieuwer in the CLI build with textual(https://github.com/Textualize/textual)

[mdless](https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless) mdless does not like it is maintained on a regular base, but it does give a good output of markdonwfiles in the cli. 

[Markdown lint tool](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) fr the MD purists a check tool for you md files. Not wel maintained.
