# [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) is a great alternative for screen!

If you have copy-paste problems with zellij try to add the line "mouse_mode false"  to the config.kdl file. after adding this line you really hae to kill all running zellij otherwise it wont help.


```bash
echo "mouse_mode false" >> ~/.config/zellij/config.kdl
```
