## 🥄 What Is This?

**Benjamin’s Culinary Logbook** is a archive of my favorite dishes, ideas, and kitchen experiments. Each recipe is carefully generated with the help of advanced AI, tailored to be both **nutritious** and **delicious**, then curated by me.

These aren't just AI recipes copied and pasted — they’re meals I actually love, trust, and remember. That’s why I keep them right here, in one place.
