## 🥄 What Is This?

**Benjamin’s Culinary Logbook** is more than just a recipe book — it's a growing archive of my favorite dishes, ideas, and kitchen experiments. Each recipe is carefully generated with the help of advanced AI, tailored to be both **nutritious** and **delicious**, then curated by me.

These aren't just AI recipes copied and pasted — they’re meals I actually love, trust, and remember. That’s why I keep them right here, in one place.

## 👨‍🍳 Why I Created This

I started using AI to speed up meal planning and explore new flavors. What I discovered was more than convenience — it was **inspiration**. These recipes sparked creativity, taught me cooking techniques, and helped me eat better. So I started saving the ones I truly liked.

Now, this logbook is:

- 🥗 A **personal reference** for meals I enjoy cooking  
- 🧠 A way to **learn and remember** what works best for me  
- 📚 A living, growing **culinary diary**

## ✨ A Note to the Reader

**Happy cooking,  
Benjamin**
