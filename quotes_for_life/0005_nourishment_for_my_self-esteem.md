## Alfred Lunt on Emotional Nourishment

**Alfred Lunt** (1892 – 1977), an acclaimed American stage actor known for his refined performances and partnership with his wife, **Lynn Fontanne**, once said:

> *“There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem.”*
> 
> *“Er is niets dat ik zo nodig heb als voedsel voor mijn gevoel van eigenwaarde.”*

This quote, often cited in collections of theatre and motivational sayings, reflects Lunt’s deep awareness of the emotional vulnerability behind artistic expression.
It’s believed to have been said during the mid-20th century — around the 1940s – 1950s — when Lunt and Fontanne were among Broadway’s most celebrated duos.
