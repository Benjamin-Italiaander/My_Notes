# My Curated Booklist  
## A personal selection of books that changed me  

Here’s a list of books that truly gave me something valuable — lessons, insights, and inspiration that helped me improve my life.  

I created this list mainly to remember the titles, but I also hope it can inspire others to explore some of these reads.  

For now, I’ve divided the books into two main categories:  
- **Personal Development**  
- **Improving Relationships**
