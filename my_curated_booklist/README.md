# My Curated Booklist  
## A personal selection of books that changed me  

Here’s a list of books that truly gave me something valuable — lessons, insights, and inspiration that helped me improve my life.  

I created this list mainly to remember the titles, but I also hope it can inspire others to explore some of these reads.  

For now, I’ve divided the books into two main categories:  
- **Personal Development**
- **Improving Relationships**



**Personal Development** 
- [How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)
- [Choose Again - Diederik Wolsak](https://www.diederik.org/)
