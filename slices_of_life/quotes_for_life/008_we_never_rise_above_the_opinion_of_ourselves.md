**People will never rise above their opinion of themselves**

Peter Sage

---

Peter Sage is making a **mindset statement** about how your *self-image* sets the ceiling for your life.
Here’s what he means, in simple terms:
### ⭐ The core idea
**You cannot consistently behave, choose, or grow in ways that contradict your belief about who you are.**
If you think you are “not smart,” “not lovable,” “not capable,” or “not worthy,” your life will unconsciously adjust downward to match that belief.

### 🔍 Why?
Because your **self-opinion becomes your internal limit**:

* If you believe you don’t deserve good things → you sabotage them.
* If you see yourself as small → you avoid big opportunities.
* If you think you’re a failure → you act in ways that confirm it.
* If you think you're strong and worthy → you treat yourself better and take bigger steps.

Your brain always tries to keep your life **consistent with your identity**.

### 🌱 What he’s encouraging
He’s basically saying:

> **If you want your life to grow, your self-image must grow first.**

Not by pretending or faking confidence, but by slowly changing the beliefs you hold about yourself:

* believing you *can* learn
* believing you *are* worthy
* believing you *can* change
* believing you *are* allowed to succeed

### 🧭 A simple example

Two people start a course.

**Person A:** “I’m dumb, I’ll probably fail.”
→ They study less, feel ashamed, avoid asking questions, and eventually quit.

**Person B:** “I’m capable of learning this.”
→ They try, ask help, stay with it, and improve.

Same situation — but their **self-opinion** decides their outcome.

### 💬 In short
He’s telling you that:
**Your self-belief is the foundation of every success, relationship, risk, healing, and dream.
Raise your opinion of yourself → and your entire life rises with it.**
