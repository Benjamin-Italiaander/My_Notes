## Two Gun Crowley — The “Cop Killer”

Before he was caught, **Francis “Two Gun” Crowley** left this note on a piece of paper:

> *“To whom it may concern:
> Under my coat is a weary heart — but a kind one,
> one that would do nobody any harm.”*

Crowley was later sentenced to death by the electric chair.
When he arrived at the death house in **Sing Sing Prison**, the guards told him what awaited him.

> **They told him:**
> “This is what you get for killing people.”

> **He replied:**
> “No — this is what I get for defending myself.”

**The point:**
Two Gun Crowley didn’t see himself as guilty. He blamed no one — not even himself.
