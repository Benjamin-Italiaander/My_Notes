## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Make the marinade:**  
   Peel the garlic. Zest and juice the lime. In a bowl, mix the olive oil, tamari (or soy sauce), pressed garlic, lime juice, salt, and chili pepper.

2. **Prepare the portabellas:**  
   Gently wipe the portabellas clean and slice into thick strips. Coat them in the marinade or brush them generously. Let sit to absorb flavor.

3. **Make the mash:**  
   Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Wash or peel the potatoes and parsnips, and cut into equal-sized pieces. Boil for 20 minutes until tender. Drain, reserving some cooking water. Mash with a splash of the water to achieve a creamy texture. Season with salt and pepper.  
   💡 *Tip:* Add a drizzle of olive oil for creaminess without using dairy.

4. **Sauté the vegetables:**  
   Slice the red onions into half rings. Cut the spring onions into batons. Heat olive oil in a pan (or two) and sauté the portabellas with onions and spring onions on medium heat until golden. Deglaze with the leftover marinade.

5. **Serve:**  
   Spoon the mash onto plates. Top with a handful of fresh arugula and a generous serving of the sautéed portabellas and pan juices.
