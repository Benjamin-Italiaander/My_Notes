# The Glass Ceiling in Your Mind
Why do intelligent, motivated people procrastinate? Why do so many of us self-sabotage, even when we gain new opportunities or learn new skills?
It often feels like there’s a glass ceiling we can’t break through—no matter what we do.

One thing is certain: it’s not a lack of resources or opportunity.
We live in a time with more access than ever. Some people have everything at their disposal and achieve nothing. Others start with nothing and still create magic—people like Colonel Sanders, Oprah, Helen Keller, or Albert Einstein, who dropped out of school and failed exams before changing the world.

So if resources aren’t the key, what is?

Our nervous system is wired for comfort.
But our deeper self—our potential—is wired for growth.
The tension between comfort and growth keeps many people trapped in mediocrity.

To understand how to break free, we need to look at the brain.

## **The Childhood Blueprint**
The part of the brain responsible for reasoning and decision-making—the neocortex—doesn’t fully turn on until around age seven. Before that, children live in a state where imagination is high and critical thinking is low. They absorb everything.

This is why childhood experiences shape our self-image.

Imagine a father taking his child, little Johnny, shopping. The father is stressed—bills, work, relationship issues. At the checkout, Johnny wants a toy. He insists. The father snaps and says:

“You don’t deserve it. You’re not good enough.”

The father didn’t mean it.
But Johnny doesn’t hear context; he hears truth.
And many adults carry these unconscious messages—*I’m not enough, I don’t deserve it*—for the rest of their lives. They sabotage success to stay consistent with that old belief.

This leads to the **first law of personal growth**:

> **People will never rise above the opinion they have of themselves.**

And that opinion is usually formed *before* we even remember forming it.

## **The Habit Problem**

The brain wants to save energy.
If you repeat a behavior—healthy or unhealthy—your brain hands it off to the “midbrain,” where it becomes automatic.

That’s how habits form, including the habits that hurt us.

Most people live 95% of their life on autopilot.
Like an ant walking on the back of an elephant, the conscious mind can try to move north… but the elephant—the unconscious—may be walking south.

Unless we change the elephant’s direction, we keep repeating the same patterns.

## **Environment Beats Willpower**

Your intentions matter far less than your environment.

Spend five days in a car with someone who plays jazz, and you’ll start tapping your foot to jazz—even if you hate it.

We don’t get to choose *whether* we are programmed.
Only *how*.

You can have the strongest will in the world, but if you spend your time around negativity, fear, gossip, or people who pull you down… your default mindset will turn negative too.

**Love your family—but choose your friends.**

## **So how do we change?

Three steps:**

### **1. Stop putting the wrong things in.**

Your mind adapts to whatever you feed it.
If you watch negative news every day, you will think negatively—it’s that simple.

You can’t say “I want to be positive” while constantly consuming fear-driven content.

### **2. Start putting the right things in.**

Fill your mind with:

* Books
* Podcasts
* Inspirational people
* Stories of those who overcame the odds

Expose yourself to what supports the person you want to become.

### **3. Remove the old patterns.**

Work with someone—a coach, mentor, or therapist—who can help uncover and clear the unconscious beliefs behind procrastination and self-sabotage.

Sometimes the problem isn’t what we think.
A client once told me he needed time-management skills.
After two minutes, it was clear he didn’t have a time problem—he had a *rejection* problem.
He couldn’t say “no,” so he overloaded his schedule.

Fix the real issue, and the surface problem disappears.

When we clear our unconscious programming, build better habits, and consciously reset our inner compass, we move toward self-mastery.

Self-mastery is the ability to remain centered even when everything around us is chaotic. It’s what allows us to handle uncertainty with confidence.

And when we master ourselves, we become examples—not by forcing others to change, but by inspiring them to.

As Gandhi said:

> **Be the change you wish to see in the world.**
