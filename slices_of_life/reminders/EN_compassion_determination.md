# Three Things That Always Help Me
There's three things that I think always help me.

## 1. Compassion for Other People

First of all, have compassion for other people.
Treat people like you would like to be treated.
Treat people nicely on your way up. You might meet them on the way down.

It's nice to be important, but it's also more important to be nice.

So, that was the first thing, compassion for other people.

## 2. Be Responsible for Your Own Self-Determination

The second thing is be responsible for your own self-determination.
You got to earn it.

Don't look at somebody else.
Don't blame somebody else.

You be responsible for your own self-determination and have accountability for what your life is and what you need to do.

## 3. It's Not About Beating the Other Guy

And the last thing is all it's not about beating the other guy.
It's not about being better than somebody else.
It's about you being the best that you can be.

You know, we won 26 games when I played Pop Warner football in a row.
Then we won 30 some in high school in a row.

And it was never good enough.
And I could never understand that.

But my dad said,
**"It's not about beating the other guy. It's about you being the best that you can be at whatever you choose to"**
