# Modern Love and Emotional Defensiveness
People nowadays aren't capable of loving. 
They're too protective. 
They're too defensive.
They don't want to feel hurt because they don't want to be hurt. 
They don't want to give so much of themselves. 
They don't want to be generous with their spirit. 
They want to protect themselves.

So, at the slightest kind of conflict with with their partner, they retreat and they get into their shell. People are more defensive. They're more locked inside themselves. They're more locked inside their phone.

So, I wite a book about this because it seems like romantic love between a man and a woman is seen as something corny and sentimental and old-fashioned and like we've outgrown that here in the 21st century.

Man, that is really sad and that is really pathetic of you and that is really actually to deprive yourself of some of the greatest emotions that a human have.
