# Friendship, Loyalty, and Showing Up

And I remember telling one of my close friends, I said, we we were riding bikes somewhere and I just out of the blue, I don't know why it hit me, I I turned to him and I said, you know, you're one of those friends that if I was really in the I would call you.

And his reaction is he didn't say thank you.
He said, **"I'd be mad if you didn't."**

The reason I bring it up is it's the same in a relationship, which is:

* when you don't call me and ask me for help,
* when you don't call me and say, "I need to cry,"
* when you don't call me and say, "I'm in the mud,"

you deny me the opportunity, the joy, the honor of sitting in the mud with me
