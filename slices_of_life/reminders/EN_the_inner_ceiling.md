# The Glass Ceiling in Your Mind
#### Why Do Intelligent People Procrastinate?

Why is it that intelligent people procrastinate? Why is it that people who are so self-motivated often self-sabotage? And why is it that no matter how many new business opportunities we get or new skills we try to learn, many of us simply find different ways of earning the same amount of money or achieving the same level of success?

It’s as if there is a glass ceiling above our head that we’re trying to break through, but don’t know how.

One thing we *do* know is that this is **not** due to a lack of resources or opportunity.
We live in a time in history where there are more resources and opportunities than ever before.

Some people have every advantage and still achieve mediocre results, while others with **no** resources or opportunity rise up against the odds and create magic—people like Colonel Sanders, Oprah, Helen Keller, or Albert Einstein (who dropped out of school at 15 and failed the entrance exam for the Zurich Polytechnic).

If you want proof that resources and opportunity are *not* the root cause of success or failure, study the lives of these people.

# Comfort vs. Growth

Human beings are wired for **comfort**.
But the deeper part of us—call it our soul—is wired for **growth**.

Managing the tension between the comfort zone and the call of our potential is what keeps most people frustrated and stuck on the “hamster wheel” of mediocrity.

# Understanding the Brain

What separates us from almost all of the animal kingdom is the front part of the brain—the **neocortex** or frontal lobe. It operates in the alpha and beta brainwave states, but it doesn’t fully activate until around **age seven**.

Children operate in delta and theta waves—hence why they sleep a lot and why their world is full of imagination but little critical thinking.
This also makes them extremely **impressionable**.

Aristotle famously said:

> “Give me the child for seven years, and I will show you the man.”

## Why this matters for procrastination and self-sabotage

Consider this example:

A stressed father takes little Johnny shopping. Dad is worried about bills, job security, and a fight he had with his wife that morning. Johnny sees toys at the checkout and asks:

> “Daddy, can I have a toy?”

Dad, frustrated and overwhelmed, snaps:

> “You can’t have a toy. You don’t deserve it. You’re not good enough.”

Johnny doesn’t hear *context*.
He hears a **truth** about himself.

He absorbs the belief:

* *I’m not good enough.*
* *I’m not worth it.*
* *I don’t deserve things.*

Many people spend the rest of their lives unconsciously acting out those beliefs—self-sabotaging when success threatens to contradict their internal identity.

# The First Law of Personal Growth

> **People will never rise above the opinion they have of themselves.**

And most people’s self-opinion was formed in early childhood—based on how they perceived the love they received or didn’t receive.

This also relates to the first law of relationships:

> **No one can love us more than we love ourselves.**

# Creatures of Habit

The neocortex is prime real estate. Though it’s only 1/50th of the body weight, it uses 20% of all calories. Because it’s expensive to use, the brain automates tasks as habits.

If you repeatedly make a choice (e.g., choosing fries over salad), the brain stops using conscious thinking and turns it into an **unconscious habit**.

This is useful (e.g., learning to walk) but also problematic.
We end up living **95% of life on autopilot**.

It’s like this:

### **The Ant and the Elephant Analogy**

* The **ant** = conscious mind (5%)
* The **elephant** = unconscious mind (95%)

The ant may be marching north with goals and motivation, but if the elephant is walking south, *guess who wins.*

---

# The Compass Analogy

The mind is like a **compass needle** that can point only in one direction at a time.

* In conscious mode, we can manually move it anywhere.
* But as soon as we let go, it drifts back to its **default magnetic north**.

For most people, that default is **negative**, not positive.

# Environment Trumps Willpower

Your environment will always beat your intention over time.

Example:
If you hate jazz but spend 5 days in a car with someone who plays jazz…
By day 3 you’re tapping your foot, and by day 5 you’re humming in the shower.

### Humans are programmable by design.

We don’t choose *whether* we are programmed—only *how*.

You can want to be positive, but if you live around chronic negativity, you will eventually conform.

> **Love your family. Choose your friends.**

# How to Change Your Programming

### Three Steps

## **1. Stop putting the wrong things in**

Your mind adapts to whatever you feed it.

The biggest unconscious influences are:

* Mainstream media
* Peer group

Mainstream media isn’t designed to inform—it’s designed to trigger the amygdala with negativity to capture attention.

You can’t watch the news daily and remain positive.
It's like trying to get healthy while smoking.

## **2. Start putting the right things in**

We now have unprecedented access to:

* Books
* Podcasts
* Interviews
* Biographies of great people

Expose your mind to information that supports your potential.

If you don’t direct your mental programming, someone else will.

## **3. Remove what shouldn’t be there**

Work with a coach, mentor, or therapist who can help uncover unconscious patterns.

Example:
A client thought he needed time-management skills.
The real issue? Fear of rejection.
He couldn’t say “no,” so he overloaded his schedule.

Fix the root, and the symptoms disappear.

# The Goal: Self-Mastery

When we clear old programming, build better habits, and consciously direct our inner compass, we move toward **self-mastery**.

Self-mastery allows us to stay centered even when everything around us is chaotic.

When we master ourselves, we inspire others—not by forcing them, but by being an example.

As Gandhi said:

> **“Be the change you wish to see in the world.”**

Why do intelligent, motivated people procrastinate? Why do so many of us self-sabotage, even when we gain new opportunities or learn new skills?
It often feels like there’s a glass ceiling we can’t break through—no matter what we do.

One thing is certain: it’s not a lack of resources or opportunity.
We live in a time with more access than ever. Some people have everything at their disposal and achieve nothing. Others start with nothing and still create magic—people like Colonel Sanders, Oprah, Helen Keller, or Albert Einstein, who dropped out of school and failed exams before changing the world.

So if resources aren’t the key, what is?

Our nervous system is wired for comfort.
But our deeper self—our potential—is wired for growth.
The tension between comfort and growth keeps many people trapped in mediocrity.

To understand how to break free, we need to look at the brain.

## **The Childhood Blueprint**
The part of the brain responsible for reasoning and decision-making—the neocortex—doesn’t fully turn on until around age seven. Before that, children live in a state where imagination is high and critical thinking is low. They absorb everything.

This is why childhood experiences shape our self-image.

Imagine a father taking his child, little Johnny, shopping. The father is stressed—bills, work, relationship issues. At the checkout, Johnny wants a toy. He insists. The father snaps and says:

“You don’t deserve it. You’re not good enough.”

The father didn’t mean it.
But Johnny doesn’t hear context; he hears truth.
And many adults carry these unconscious messages—*I’m not enough, I don’t deserve it*—for the rest of their lives. They sabotage success to stay consistent with that old belief.

This leads to the **first law of personal growth**:

> **People will never rise above the opinion they have of themselves.**

And that opinion is usually formed *before* we even remember forming it.

## **The Habit Problem**

The brain wants to save energy.
If you repeat a behavior—healthy or unhealthy—your brain hands it off to the “midbrain,” where it becomes automatic.

That’s how habits form, including the habits that hurt us.

Most people live 95% of their life on autopilot.
Like an ant walking on the back of an elephant, the conscious mind can try to move north… but the elephant—the unconscious—may be walking south.

Unless we change the elephant’s direction, we keep repeating the same patterns.

## **Environment Beats Willpower**

Your intentions matter far less than your environment.

Spend five days in a car with someone who plays jazz, and you’ll start tapping your foot to jazz—even if you hate it.

We don’t get to choose *whether* we are programmed.
Only *how*.

You can have the strongest will in the world, but if you spend your time around negativity, fear, gossip, or people who pull you down… your default mindset will turn negative too.

**Love your family—but choose your friends.**

## **So how do we change?

Three steps:**

### **1. Stop putting the wrong things in.**

Your mind adapts to whatever you feed it.
If you watch negative news every day, you will think negatively—it’s that simple.

You can’t say “I want to be positive” while constantly consuming fear-driven content.

### **2. Start putting the right things in.**

Fill your mind with:

* Books
* Podcasts
* Inspirational people
* Stories of those who overcame the odds

Expose yourself to what supports the person you want to become.

### **3. Remove the old patterns.**

Work with someone—a coach, mentor, or therapist—who can help uncover and clear the unconscious beliefs behind procrastination and self-sabotage.

Sometimes the problem isn’t what we think.
A client once told me he needed time-management skills.
After two minutes, it was clear he didn’t have a time problem—he had a *rejection* problem.
He couldn’t say “no,” so he overloaded his schedule.

Fix the real issue, and the surface problem disappears.

When we clear our unconscious programming, build better habits, and consciously reset our inner compass, we move toward self-mastery.

Self-mastery is the ability to remain centered even when everything around us is chaotic. It’s what allows us to handle uncertainty with confidence.

And when we master ourselves, we become examples—not by forcing others to change, but by inspiring them to.

As Gandhi said:

> **Be the change you wish to see in the world.**
