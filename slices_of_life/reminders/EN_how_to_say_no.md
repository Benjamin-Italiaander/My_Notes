# How to say no

Here’s where the mistake usually happens:
We feel, *“I don’t want to disappoint them. I don’t want them to dislike me.”*
And then we respond with something like: *“Oh wow, that sounds great, I’d love to… **but** I can’t, I have a full day of meetings.”*

The problem is the word **“but.”**
“**But**” has a way of erasing everything that came before it.
If you say, *“I love you, but…”* whatever comes after makes the first part feel less genuine.

Instead, flip the structure:

1. **Start with the “no.”**
2. **End with gratitude or kindness.**

So if someone invites you to dinner while you’re traveling, you might say:

*“I can’t make it, but thank you so much for inviting me. It sounds wonderful. I’d really love to meet you next time I’m in town. And I’ve heard that restaurant is amazing—hope you have a great evening!”*

It’s clearer, kinder, and more respectful.
And honestly, people prefer a direct “no” rather than a hesitant “yes but…”.
