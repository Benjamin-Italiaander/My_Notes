**Improving Relationships - English**
- Love phobia: how to overcome your fear of commitment and abandonment - Hannah Cuppen
- The Hold Me Tight: Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love -  [Sue Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Johnson)
  
> Although *Hold Me Tight* was originally written as a guide for Christian couples, I strongly recommend this book to all couples, regardless of their background, culture, or religion.
> Its insights into emotional connection, healthy communication, and secure bonding are universal and meaningful for anyone who wants to build a deeper, stronger, and more loving relationship.
