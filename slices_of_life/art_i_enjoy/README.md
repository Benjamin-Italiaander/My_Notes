## How It All Started ðŸŒ¸âœ¨

Under the cheerful influence of my ex-girlfriend **Hannah**, I once bought a piece of Japanese art from an online auction straight from Japan.  
When that first scroll arrived, it instantly filled me with joy â€” the colours, the calmness, the stories hidden in every brushstroke!  
From that moment on, I completely fell in love with traditional Japanese art.  
I kept exploring, discovering, and collecting a few more beautiful pieces that made me smile.  
Here, Iâ€™m sharing some of the artworks that continue to bring me peace, happiness, and inspiration. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸ’«
