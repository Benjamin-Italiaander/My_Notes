# Discovering Takamizawa Mokuhansha and the Art of Japanese Lithography

During my search for *Takamizawa Mokuhansha*, a Japanese wood-block print publisher, I came across the website of **George C. Baxley**, who shared some wonderful images showing how lithographs and wood-block prints are made.  

On his site, he states:

> “Any person is hereby authorized to view, copy, print and distribute this document subject to the following conditions:  
> – The document may be used for personal informational purposes only;  
> – The document may only be used for non-commercial purposes;  
> – Any copy of this document, or any portion thereof, must include this copyright notice.”

Based on that, I believe I’m allowed to use some of these beautiful images from his site to illustrate how the different wood-block and lithographic prints were created.  

Baxley’s website also includes a fascinating history of the **Fujiya Hotel**, complete with images, drawings, and lithographs.  
Altogether, I decided to keep these here because I really enjoy them and want to share them — especially the Japanese art, which I find particularly inspiring.

Active roughly from the **1930s through the 1980s**, the firm was renowned for **high-quality colour reproductions** of classical ukiyo-e prints as well as a number of original designs.

Their reproductions often included complete sets of historic works, such as **Hiroshige’s _The 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō_**, rendered with remarkable fidelity.  
Prints by Takamizawa were typically marked with the company’s seal “高見沢木版社”, which confirmed authenticity and separated them from lower-quality reproductions of the era.

### Significance  
Takamizawa Mokuhansha played an important role in preserving and popularizing **traditional Japanese printmaking** during the 20th century.  
Their studio combined the craftsmanship of hand-carved blocks and hand-printed colours with modern distribution, allowing global audiences to experience the beauty of classic ukiyo-e designs.
